### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

Happy with my progress in REACT.JS. My next steps are to learn NEXT.JS and later perfect MERN stack.

### Useful resources

- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Yes, I google. My first move to a problem that I don't have any idea about. You should try it.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helps me always.I have come to realize that for any problem I encounter, I am not the first, stack overflow always has my back.

- [ReactJs](https://react.dev) - This helps me to work with different components seamlessly just as mentioned in their docs.Javascript all through.

- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com) - This is the best way of styling in my opinion.

- [DaisyUi](https://daisyui.com) - This is the most popular component library for Tailwind CSS. It helps get more logical class names to Tailwind css.
